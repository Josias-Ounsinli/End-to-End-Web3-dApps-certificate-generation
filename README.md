# End-to-End Web3 dApps: certificate generation, distribution, and value transfer with Algorand NFTs and smart contracts

## Business Objective
An organization (10 Academy), aware of the user controlled internet technology (Web3), would like to use it to deliver certificates to its trainees. The challenge is to ensure that certificates are available to all trainees in a secure way, and (if possible) that certificate holders can benefit from smart contract actions now and in the future. To solve this challenge, the Algorand Blockchain will be used to generate and distribute Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as certificates to 10 Academy trainees. To do that, we will build an end-to-end Web3 dapps on the Algorand Blockchain that will help 10 Academy generate trainees’s certificates that will represent the successful completion of a weekly challenge to trainees, and allow trainees with NFTs to interact with a smart contract to perform predefined actions. Before going to the dapp for certificate generation, it’s important to have a look at Web3 technology and its related concepts.

## Web3 technology
Web3 is a recent technology developed to improve, solve and overcome the limitations of its predecessor (Web2). Despite the improvement provided by web2 through the development of cookies and centralized services, it was not able to solve these two problems:
Hold “state” independent of trusted operators: only the service providers have control over their state provided and the user does not have any control over which provider is giving them state or have access to their state.
Transfer state: there is no way for the user to transfer his state.
Thus, Web3 known as a user controlled internet comes into play with its amazing advance providing these solutions:
The creation of native economic value by any participant; and
The transfer of this native value to any participant.
WIth Web3 a user can hold his state and transfer it: this can be seen as the main difference between Web2 and Web3.
Web3 technology has been developed starting from blockchains (concepts explained later on in this document) that provide a way to hold state. The web3 stack currently looks like in the below figure. It is made up of modular components that allow state to be shared among all participants while preventing vendor lock-in to layers below. Because of this, if an application wants to change the state layer, it does not need to rewrite its entire stack (i.e. blockchain). This is effective because it fosters healthy competition and allows each layer to preserve the value it creates without having to worry about what will happen if the rules of the game change later on.
